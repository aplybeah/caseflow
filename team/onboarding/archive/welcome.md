This is a former Digital Service team member focused welcome document.

# **Welcome to the team!**

The Digital Service at Veterans Affairs (DSVA) joined forces with the [Board of Veterans' Appeals](http://www.bva.va.gov/) (aka the Board or BVA) in the summer of 2015 to jumpstart the modernization of appeals tracking and processing across the Department.  We're excited that you will be joining!

**Before we get started,** let's dive into a quick overview of what a Veteran would do when he or she would like to file a claim for earned benefits with the VA. Veterans can find [details](http://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/benefits-summary/SummaryofVABenefitsFlyer.pdf) online regarding [benefits](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-27-0501-ARE.pdf) that are available. To begin the claims process, a Veteran can take advantage of a number of [options](http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/apply.asp), including [filing a claim online](http://explore.va.gov/file-claim).

The [Veterans Benefits Administration](http://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/about.asp) (VBA) manages this process.

**Let's rewind** a few years to provide you with context and an understanding of the road that led us here today.  Back in 2013, the backlog of claims to be decided grew to more than 600k. Many stakeholders put a lot of effort and attention towards [reducing this backlog](http://nation.time.com/2013/06/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-va-backlog/).  This priority allowed the Department to execute [a plan](http://www.benefits.va.gov/transformation/about_transformation.asp) to address the situation (see [page 9](http://www.veteranslawlibrary.com/files/VA_Strategic_Plan_to_Eliminate_the_Compensation_Claims_Backlog.pdf) for an overview of technology solutions and an intro to the Veterans Benefits Management System, aka VBMS).  VBMS is the claims processing system that was created and is managed by VBA. 

The focus at the time was [clearing](http://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/infographics/BelowSixFigures.html) the claims backlog, and, therefore, the features that were built into the new VBMS system reflected this prioritization.  *Quick note - when you hear 'eFolder' this is the repository that holds all of a Veterans' electronic documents in VBMS.  You may also sometimes hear Virtual VA (VVA), which is an older system that is being deprecated, but continues to hold some documents.*  

**Now back to the Board.** Veterans have [a right](http://vaww.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA4107.pdf) to [appeal](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/) their claim decisions.  Members of [the Board](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title38/part5/chapter71&edition=prelim) review benefit claims determinations made by local VA offices (Agency of Original Jurisdiction/AOJ - most often VBA [Regional Offices](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp)/ROs) and issue decisions on appeals. These Law Judges (attorneys experienced in veterans law and in reviewing benefit claims) are the only ones who can issue Board decisions. Staff attorneys, also trained in veterans law, review the facts of each appeal and assist the Board members.  

You can check out the Board's [most recent](http://www.bva.va.gov/docs/Chairmans_Annual_Rpts/BVA2014AR.pdf) [annual report](http://www.bva.va.gov/Chairman_Annual_Rpts.asp). There are many specifics that we'll spend more time diving into, but the chart in this [Appeals 101](http://www.bva.va.gov/docs/Appeals101Briefing.pdf) presentation will give you a great initial overview of the appeals process.

**The quick appeals summary:** it's a complicated process/system, because appeals are processed more like ['a never-ending claims process'](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/Archive/appeals-modernization/Revised%20Appeals%20White%20Paper%20-%20March%202015.pdf) rather than a review of the prior decision.  The appeals are open-records, which means an appellant can continue to [submit additional evidence](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-veterans-appeals-backlog-20151123-story.html), which also triggers the need for a fresh view of the entire case.   Rather than an end-to-end process, there are many loops in the process that make it very very lengthy ([years](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/22/veterans-wait-years-for-disability-appeals-process/), not months).  

In case you want more details, this [overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/Archive/appeals-modernization/VA%20Appeals%20Plan%20-%20February%202014.pdf) will give you more context. One important thing that you will notice is that there is no single solution that will fully improve the effectiveness and efficiency of providing Veterans with the service that they have earned and deserve. Both policy and technology changes are critical to driving the improvements necessary - and both are being pursued.  *(Note that the figures may be a bit outdated in some of these documents, but they are reflective of the overall situation.  For older documents, the forward-looking solutions and proposed legislative changes don't reflect the latest plan.)*

Check out the appeals reform section of this [press release](http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2746) for information from the President's FY17 budget.

**What does this process look like from a [Veteran's perspective](http://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/25331/listening-to-the-voices-of-veterans-and-their-journey-in-the-appeals-system/)?** The VA Center for Innovation prepared a [full report](http://www.innovation.va.gov/docs/VOV_Appeals_FINAL_20160115.pdf) that reinforces the importance and potential impact of solving these issues. You can also review a copy of the [current guidance](http://www.bva.va.gov/docs/Pamphlets/How-Do-I-Appeal-Booklet--508Compliance.pdf) provided to Veterans when filing an appeal.   

**Back to the technology.** As VBMS was being developed to support the claims process, the Board continued to rely on existing tools and technology to process and track appeals.  Currently, Board employees and anyone processing appeals use a combination of VBMS and other systems.

**What is this tool that the Board has been using to track appeals?** In the 1980s, a Board employee and hero (Jed Wagner) created the Veterans Appeals Control and Locator System (VACOLS) to help track appeals as they moved throughout the Department. This was a particularly important system, because as cases started to become paperless (note: today, we are moving to a more paperless system, but some are still paper or hybrid), the Board had to keep even better track of them.  For more details, check out this [exec summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/VA%20Tech%20System%20Documentation/VACOLS/VACOLS_Preread.md).

In summary, the Board has been planning to replace VACOLS for a long time (see bottom of page 21, [1992 Annual Report](http://www.bva.va.gov/docs/Chairmans_Annual_Rpts/BVA1992AR.pdf)). And this is where we come in (more or less).  The new system that we are developing is known as Caseflow - it will provide the Department with the tools necessary to track and process appeals effectively and efficiently.  Caseflow will involve custom-built components, off-the-shelf software (such as an eReader), and integrations with VA systems.  The [business case](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/caseflow/system%20documents/caseflow_business-case.md) will provide you with important context.  

**The DSVA team has documented the full history** of [our team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digitalservice/blob/master/comms/team-bios.md) and created a [timeline of events](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/digitalservice/blob/master/administration/timeline.md). You'll notice our focus shifted from claims to appeals and you will also find details regarding all of the work that went into building the DSVA.  If you want a much more detailed look at recent progress on the Appeals Modernization project, check out our [weekly updates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/archive/weeklyUpdate.md)**_(as of 6/6/16)_**.  We also upload our [bi-weekly sprint presentations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/tree/master/archive/sprint-archive) **_(as of 6/6/16)_**.

**A lot has happened, but let's dive into some of the highlights to give you more context:**

You can review the [60-day sprint presentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/archive/appeals-modernization/DSVA%20Discovery%20Sprint%20Recommendations%208-20-2015.pdf) that kicked off our involvement in the Appeals Modernization project (noting that there have been some changes since).  Our methodology is rooted in the [Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/).

We have documented our [project priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/priorities.md) and [a high-level roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/tree/master/budgeting/roadmap).  

Our partnership with the Board is captured by a [Memorandum of Understanding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/memos/Appeals%20Modernization%20MOU_Signed.pdf) (MOU). 

Our [team] is organized according to this [delivery model](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/Archive/delivery-model/Appeals%20Delivery%20Model%201-25-16.pdf) and we're fortunate to have strong support from leadership.  When there is a production issue our [prod squad](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/%5B%5BReview%5D%5D/how-we-work/Prod%20Squad.md) is fast on the duty.  Here is a [BVA organization chart](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/Archive/201702%20BVA%20Organization%20Chart.pdf). 

[Caseflow Certification](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/Government%20Inquiries/Caseflow%20Certification%20Overview%20-%20VBA.docx), a tool that Robert Sosinski (Presidential Innovation Fellow/PIF) originally developed, is the first product to go live with users.  *Caseflow certification was previously known as just Caseflow - not to be confused with Caseflow as it is known today.* You can also check out a [demo video](https://vaww.vaco.portal.va.gov/sites/BVA/olkm/DigitalService/Shared%20Documents/Caseflow%20Demo.m4v.zip).

Recently, we've prepared responses to inquires from Congress, which you can [read](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/Government%20Inquiries/Congressional/ctr_response.md) through and [review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-pm/blob/master/Archive/appeals-modernization/Appeals%20Management%20Briefing%20Slides%20(Jan%202016%20Draft).pdf).
